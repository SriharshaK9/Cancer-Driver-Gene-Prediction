# Cancer-Driver-Gene-Prediction
Developed an ML-based system to identify cancer driver genes from NGS data. Used PRIM and AAPIV for feature extraction to generate numerical representations. Trained/evaluated SVM, Neural Networks, and Random Forest models to support early cancer diagnosis and gene mutation research.
